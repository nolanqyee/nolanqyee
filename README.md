## Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a senior at James E. Taylor High School with a strong passion for exploring how technology, especially AI, and the arts can intersect to solve societal problems. As an active and engaged STEM student, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to innovate and apply my tech skills to create positive change, whether that's through artificial intelligence, software development, or web design. If our goals align, I'd love to connect!

If our interests align, feel free to contact me: nolanyee99@gmail.com
